/**
 * Ownership of a submission after the transport dies.

 * Output cannot answer it: `touch marker && sleep 400` changes the working tree

 * command as never sent and offered the `!` text back — inviting a second run of
 * work that had already happened. The child now announces admission for every
 * correlated request before its handler touches anything, and the host restores
 * a draft only for a transport failure that arrived without one.
